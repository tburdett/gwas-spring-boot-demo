GWAS Spring Boot Demo
=====================

This application was created using the Spring Boot Initializr: http://start.spring.io/

It utilises JDBC, JPA, Solr, Web, Rest Repositories, Thymelead, Actuator and Remote Shell.

This is a demo application that uses an embedded Derby database to persist some basic GWAS information, and serves this data through a HATEOAS RESTful interface.

It should build and run using an embedded Tomcat instance on http://localhost:8080.

Enjoy!
